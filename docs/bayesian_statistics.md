### Bayesian Statistics

1) The [make_region_score.ipynb](../Immaterial_index/make_region_score.ipynb) creates the following column in the Sqlite3 db: region_score

2) Run the following script [bayesian_statistics/make_stats.ipynb](../bayesian_statistics/make_stats.ipynb) creates [data_stats.csv](../bayesian_statistics/results/data_stats.csv) and [data_stats_clean_gdp.csv](../bayesian_statistics/results/data_stats_clean.csv) which is the table with the stats of regions merged with region score for all individuals for normal and clean_gdp_data.

3) Run [bayesian_statistics/BRM.ipynb](../bayesian_statistics/BRM.ipynb) to launch the analysis
